2ยบ project of data base management system 

In this project it's given the challange to put in practice how to make the code to manage a data base using the programming language php.
The objective is to be able to add different sorts of data on a data base from a clinic that treats kids with autism.
I'm finding it really fun to work with, there are some small challanges but with effort I could pass through them with no worries.
Also I want to add that I'm not doing the project alone, it's a group project, my files on the project are "gestao-de-registos", "insercao-de-valores" and "edicao-de-dados".
